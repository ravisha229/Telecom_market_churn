# Telecom_market_churn

In this project, I have tried to solve an important problem of telecom industry. In the industry it is very easy to retain an old customer rather than acquiring a new one.
So telecom company should be interested in prediction for a customer to leave the company's services so that company can make decisions to retain maximum of them.
I have done some exploratory data analysis on the company's customers and found following:
- It can be esily seen the customers who are purchasing the international planes are more likely to leave the company than those who don't.

- Customers who are calling customer service more times are more likely to leave.
- Customers who are using day services more are more likely to leave

After applying many classification algorithms found maximum ROC-AUC of 0.90 for RandomForest algorithm with ~95% precision and ~99% recall
